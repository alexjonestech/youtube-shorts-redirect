# YouTube Shorts Redirect

Adds a button on YouTube shorts page in browser that can be clicked to take you to the standard watch page for that video. This lets you pause, frame advance, rewind, etc. a short the same way you would a standard video. The same effect can be achieved by replacing "shorts" in the url with "watch", but the button makes it super convenient if you do this a lot.
